Arduino Examples
================

A collection of code examples for Arduino boards and other similar devices
(ESP8266, Teensy, etc.) collected from my various experiments.


esp8266-temperature
-------------------

`This set of sketches <esp8266-temperature/>`_ demonstrates measuring temperature
from an ESP8266 development board with a thermistor, then submitting that value
periodically over the network to an InfluxDB database so it can be analysed and
graphed.
